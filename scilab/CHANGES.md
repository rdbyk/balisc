Feature changes and additions
-----------------------------

* `airy` has been added: Evaluation of Airy functions of the first and second kind, and their first derivative, possibly scaled.
* HTTP get, post, put, upload, patch, delete functions added
* JSON encoding / decoding for Scilab datatypes added
* Memory invalid accesses have been greatly reduced thanks to :
  - PVS-Studio inspections blog report
  - Coverity scan weekly source analysis
* `bitget` is upgraded:
  - It now accepts positive Signed encoded integers.
  - It now supports the new uint64 and int64 types of encoded integers.
  - For decimal numbers: bits with indices > 52 can now be retrieved (up to `log2(number_properties("huge"))` = 1024).
  - For decimal numbers `x > 2^52`, queried bits below `%eps` (indices < log2(x)-52) now return `Nan` instead of 0.
  - Several bits can now be retrieved from each component of an input array.
* `edit` now accepts a line number as text (like "23").
* `profileEnable`, `profileDisable`, `profileGetInfo` could be used to instrument functions and gather execution information within Scilab.
* `prettyprint` is upgraded:
  - Integer and Text input are now actually supported.
  - Default input arguments can be skipped instead of still having to be provided.
  - The result string is better formatted to be easily wrappable and indented.
* `mesh2d` has been introduced to compute a 2d mesh from vectors (x,y) of points.
* `loadmatfile` is upgraded:
  - Octave native text data files can now be read.
  - Automatic detection of the input data format implemented.
  - `-toStruct` option added, to return results in a structure instead of in the calling environment.
* `jremove` is optional and `clear` could be used to release Java objects mapped to Scilab.
* `blockdiag` is introduced to improve, replace, and extend `sysdiag` to strings.
* `assert_checkequal` is upgraded:
  - support added for Nan and void in lists, Nan in sparses, implicit lists, graphic handles, macros, libraries, and built-in.
  - For arrays of matching typeof and sizes, and for lists of matching lengths, the failure message now indicates the index and values of the first mismatching elements.
* `diophant` is improved:
  - Encoded integers are accepted, in addition to decimal numbers. Only integer solutions are then searched.
  - When there is no solution, `[]` is returned.
  - When there is an infinite number of solutions, the err flag has a specific value.
  - The output size gets the input's one.
* `editvar()` GUI support copy-paste of strings removing quotes.
* calendar() can now display formated calendars.
* `xmlSetValues()` clones `setPreferencesValue` that is now obsolete.
* `unique()` is upgraded to:
  - return the number of occurences of distinct entities found in the input array.
  - return distinct entities in their initial order (rather than sorted), with the `"keepOrder"` option.
  - consider all `Nan` values as the same one, with the `"uniqueNan"` option.
* `ellipj` function introduced, to compute the `sn`, `cn`, `dn`, `ns`, `nc` and `nd` Jacobi elliptic functions.
* `riccati` is upgraded:
  - `riccati(H)` and `riccati(H,E)` syntaxes added, to describe the Riccati equation through its Hamiltonian H or (E,H) pencil.
  - The residual is returned as a new 3rd output argument.
  - When no solution is found, `X=[]` | `X1=[]` is returned instead of yielding an error.
* `hallchart` is upgraded:
  - The default set of modules is set automatically, according to data bounds.
  - Handles of the grids and labels are returned. Post-processing them becomes easy.
  - Named colors accepted; better default colors.
  - Improved placement of labels.
* `playsnd` is upgraded:
  - the name of a wav file can now be specified (instead of the sound data).
  - the input sound can now be repeated a given number of times.
  - the modal/non-modal processing is improved.
* `nicholschart` is improved: more neutral default frame color; improved labels positionning; colors can now be specified by their predefined name or "#RRGGBB" hexa code; a structure of handles is now returned to easily postprocess both subframes and the set of labels.
* `sciargs` returns a column instead of formerly a row.
* Booleans and encoded integers can now be concatenated together, as in `[%f int8(-5)]`.
* `gsort` can now perform multilevel sorting. This noticeably allows sorting completely complex numbers.
* `factorial` can be used now from n=171 up to n=10^14.
* `intersect` now supports complex numbers.
* `setdiff` now supports complex numbers.
* `twinkle` can now blink together several hierarchically independent objects, like a curve and its labels, etc.

User Interface improvements:
----------------------------

* The `ans` variable is editable as any other variable in Editvar.
* Commands history is saved before executing a command to have the correct history on a crash.
* Used memory per variable is displayed by BrowserVar to give the user numbers on memory usage repartition and let the user `clear` the big ones first.
* Autoscroll of console in GUI mode is disabled when the user scrolls up until he scrolls to the bottom.

Xcos
----

* Default ending time reduced from 100000 to 30, to fit default scope block.

* [#15271](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15271): `bitget` needed to be upgraded.
* [#15309](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15309): `eval` was a weak duplicate of `evstr`. It should be removed.

* [#15451](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15451): The code was not adapted to use `lucene 4.10` in Debian.
* [#15514](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15514): The `set` documentation page needed to be overhauled.
* [#15517](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15517): `factorial` could be actually used up to only n=170.
* [#15522](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15522): `unique` was not able to consider all Nan values as the same value. A `uniqueNan` option now allows it.
* [#15523](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15523): `%ODEOPTIONS(1)=2` didn't work with solvers 'rk' and 'rkf'
* [#15534](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15534): Booleans and encoded integers could not be concatenated together.
* [#15577](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15577): `edit` did not accept a line number as text, as with `edit linspace 21`.
* [#15580](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15580): `det(sparse([],[]))` yielded an error.
* [#15737](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15737): `setdiff` was wrong with complex numbers.
* [#15981](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15981): `wavread` kept the wav file open and locked when returning on errors. It weakly managed the input file name. It claimed for invalid data formats instead of unsupported ones, with poor information about the current format vs the supported ones. Several error messages refered to a wrong function.
* [#15595](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15595): `unique` was not able to return distinct values in their original order, without sorting them. A `keepOrder` option now allows it.
* [#15668](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15668): `save(filename)` saved all predefined Scilab constants %e %pi etc.. (regression)
* [#15715](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15715): `%nan` indices crashed Scilab.

* [#15581](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15581): display of complex matrix was ugly.
* [#15628](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15628): `with_tk` was a duplicate of `with_module('tclsci')`. It is removed.
* [#15680](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15680): `loadmatfile` could not return variables in a structure instead of into the calling environment.
* [#15701](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15701): `A\B` was not faster when `A` is square and triangular.
* [#15734](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15734):  Trivial infinite loop could not be interrupted.

* [#15745](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15745): `diophant(0,0,m)`, `diophant([p 0],q)`, `diophant([0 p],q)` with m<>0 and p>q were wrong. There was no flag for cases with an infinite number of solutions. When there is no solution, some values were returned anyway, instead of []. In this case, the documented definition of the err value was dubious. Decimal numbers and integers were accepted, but not encoded integers. Inf and NaN input coefficients were not rejected.
* [#15812](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15812): On assigning variables the source variable may become become corrupted
* [#15821](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15821): `fac3d` and `fac3d1` were still in Scilab 6.0 despite they were tagged obsolete 14 years ago in Scilab 4.1
* [#15825](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15825): `gsort` could not sort completely dense matrices of complex numbers.
* [#15840](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15840): `grand(1,"prm",m)` yielded an unsqueezed size([size(m) 1]) hypermatrix
* [#15934](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15934): The `^ hat` page wrongly indicated that `^` applied to a rectangular matrix not being a vector is done element-wise.
* [#15948](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15948): `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `zlabel` and `title` needed to be upgraded.
* [#15964](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15954): A complex empty sparse matrix could be obtained after insertion.
* [#15965](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15965): `plot(x,y)` did not accept y as encoded integers.
* [#15967](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15967): `setdiff(1,[])` was [] instead of `1`. `setdiff(a,[],..)` was not enough tested.
* [#15969](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15969): Fix spelling
* [#15974](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15974): `msprintf("%d", %nan)` did not return Nan
* [#15977](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15977): The documentation for `wavread(..,'info')` had a mistake. The `wavread` page deserved some improvements.
* [#15978](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15978): The `writewav` page in english said that input data are one column per channel, instead of one row per channel. In addition, in case of writing error, `savewave` kept the output file open and locked.
* [#15983](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15983): `group` regressed in 5.5.2 due to a too intrusive fix.
* [#15984](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/15984): display scale was wrong with Retina dispplays on OSX..

* [#16000](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16000): `mfile2sci` converted `acoth` using `atanh` and yielding a wrong warning message.
* [#16003](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16003): Zoom with mouse scroll wheel was broken on simple surfaces.
* [#16005](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16005): The `intdec` example was biased and not robust when changing sampling frequencies.

* [#16071](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16071): `prettyprint(complex(1,%nan))` omitted the "+" in `1 + Nani`. It printed positive exponents with a useless "+". For any input nul polynomial, the string result never included the name of the variable. Default input arguments could not be skipped. ExportFormat was uselessly case-sensitive. For tex|latex: for text input, $ \ % & { } ~ and ^ special characters were not protected ; spaces were not protected, all words were concatenated ; for polynomials and rationals, the result string could be extremely long and not easily wrappable. For MathML: "<" was not protected ; <mi></mi> were missing for text input ; <mtable>, </mtable>, <mtr>, </mtr>, <mtd>, <mfenced> and </mfenced> tags were not wrapped and could not be indented. Delimiters: "" was not documented as possible value ; ")" was wrongly documented. Dynamical linear systems were not documented as possible input.

* [#16139](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16139): `auread` and `auwrite` kept the sound file open and locked when returning on errors. They poorly handled the default .au sound file extension.
* [#16140](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16140): `playsnd` could not directly accept an audio file and could not repeat the input sound.
* [#16143](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16143): `clc(n)` cleared n+1 lines instead of n>0. Thus, it was not possible to clear only one line.
* [#16144](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16144): Addition of sparse matrices gave incorrect results.
* [#16148](https://bugzilla.scilab.org/16148): `setPreferencesValue` is a general usage function and deserved to be renamed `xmlSetValues`.
