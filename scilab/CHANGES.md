Feature changes and additions
-----------------------------

* Empty strings are used as the default values on String allocation
* HTTP get, post, put, upload, patch, delete functions added
* JSON encoding / decoding for Scilab datatypes added
* Memory invalid accesses have been greatly reduced thanks to :
  - PVS-Studio inspections blog report
  - Coverity scan weekly source analysis
* bitget() is upgraded:
  - It now accepts positive Signed encoded integers.
  - It now supports the new uint64 and int64 types of encoded integers.
  - For decimal numbers: bits with indices > 52 can now be retrieved (up to `log2(number_properties("huge"))` = 1024).
  - For decimal numbers `x > 2^52`, querried bits below `%eps` (indices < log2(x)-52) now return `Nan` instead of 0.
  - Several bits can now be retrieved from each component of an input array.
* `edit` now accepts a line number as text (like "23").
* `profileEnable`, `profileDisable`, `profileGetInfo` could be used to instrument functions and gather execution information within Scilab.


Help pages:
-----------

* overhauled / rewritten: `bitget`, `edit`
* fixed / improved:  `bench_run` `M_SWITCH`

User Interface improvements:
----------------------------

* The `ans` variable is editable as any other variable
* Commands history is saved *before* executing a command to have the correct history on crash.


Xcos
----

* Default ending time reduced from 100000 to 30, to fit default scope block


API modification
----------------


Obsolete functions or features
------------------------------


Removed Functions
-----------------

* `hypermat` was obsolete and has been removed. Please use `matrix` instead.
* `square` was obsolete and has been removed.

Bug Fixes
---------

### Bugs fixed in 6.1.0:
* [#2694](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2694): `bitget` did not accept positive integers of types int8, int16 or int32.
* [#8784](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8784): Automatic self-adjusting blocks `SCALE_CSCOPE` & `SCALE_CMSCOPE` in Xcos.
* [#12520](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12520): Vriable browser did not display the size of the variables.
* [#12534](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12534): Variable browser did not display the size of the variables.
* [#14604](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14604): `emptystr()` is 40x slower with 6.0.0 wrt 5.5.2
* [#14605](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14605): fixed - `bench_run` was too strict about the specification of tests names.
* [#14606](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14606): Memory used by variables returned by `[names,mem]=who()` was always zero.
* [#14812](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14812): Minor typos in messages.
* [#14863](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14863): In Xcos, the default ending time was unhandily high (100000), reduced it to 30.
* [#14982](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14982): `msprintf` segmentation fault was caught due to wrong size
* [#15269](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15269): `xgetech` was poor and stiff compared to any combination of `gca()` properties `.axes_bounds`, `.data_bounds`, `.log_flags`, and `.margins`. It is removed.
* [#15271](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15271): `bitget` needed to be upgraded.
* [#15425](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15425): The Kronecker product `a.*.b` failed when `a` or `b` or both are hypermatrices, with one or both being polynomials or rationals.
* [#15523](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15523): `%ODEOPTIONS(1)=2` didn't work with solvers 'rk' and 'rkf' 
* [#15577](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15577): `edit` did not accept a line number as text, as with `edit linspace 21`.
* [#15983](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15983): `group()` regressed in 5.5.2 due to a too intrusive fix.
* [#16005](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16005): The `intdec` example was biased and not robust when changing sampling frequencies.
* [#16021](http://bugzilla.scilab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16021): `tand([-90 90])` answered [Nan Nan] instead of [-Inf, Inf]. `cotd([-90 90])` answered [Nan Nan] instead of [0 0]. `1 ./cosd([-90 90])` answered [Inf -Inf] instead of [Inf Inf].
