        <para>
            Right division: <literal>X=A/B</literal> is the solution of <literal>X*B=A</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            The slash (right division) and backslash (left division) operators are linked by the following equation:
            <literal>B/A=(A'\B')'</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            In the case where <literal>A</literal> is square, the
            solution <literal>X</literal> can be computed either from LU
            factorization or from a linear least squares solver. If the
            condition number of <literal>A</literal> is smaller than
            <literal>1/(10*%eps)</literal> (i.e. if <literal>A</literal> is
            well conditioned), the LU factorization with row pivoting is
            used. If not (i.e. if <literal>A</literal> is poorly
            conditioned), then <literal>X</literal> is the minimum-norm
            solution which minimizes <literal>||A*X-B||</literal> using
            a complete orthogonal factorization of <literal>A</literal>
            (i.e. <literal>X</literal> is the solution of a linear least
            squares problem).
        </para>
        <para>
            <literal>A./B</literal> is the element-wise right division, i.e.
            the matrix with entries <literal>A(i,j)/B(i,j)</literal>.
            If <literal>B</literal> is scalar (1x1 matrix) this
            operation is the same as <literal>A./B*ones(A)</literal>. Same
            convention if <literal>A</literal> is a scalar.
        </para>
        <para>
            System feed back.  <literal>S = G/.K</literal> evaluates
            <literal>S = G*(eye() + K*G)^(-1)</literal> this operator avoid
            simplification problem.
        </para>
        <note>
          Note that <literal>123./B</literal> is interpreted as <literal>(123)./B</literal>.
          In this case, the dot is part of the operator, not of the decimal number.
          <para/>
          In the opposite, <literal>G/.5</literal> is interpreted as <literal>G/(.5)</literal> :
          The dot here is part of the number, while it is not the case in
          <literal>G/. 5</literal>
        </note>
        <para>
            Comment <literal>//</literal> comments a line i.e. lines which begin by
            <literal>//</literal> are ignored by the interpreter.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is the same with <literal>/*</literal> which start to comment a block of code
            and with <literal>*/</literal> which end to comment this block.
        </para>

                  The threshold level which switches between Gaussian Elimination with row pivoting
                  and linear least squares when computing B/A is decreased from sqrt(eps) to eps.
