      <h3 class="title">Welcome to Scilab 6.0.1</h3>
      <p class="para">
        Scilab 6.0 is a major new release of Scilab, the open source
        platform for numerical computation.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Here is a tour of the changes between Scilab 6.0.0 &amp; 6.0.1.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Feature Improvements</h2>
      <p class="para">
        The console &quot;File => Open a file&quot; menu now allows to open *.xcos *.zcos *.scg or lib
        files with the proper Scilab component, and other files with the proper OS application.
        All files were opened in Scinotes and could freeze it.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
       &quot;gcd&quot; and &quot;lcm&quot; of integers now always return a positive result.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        &quot;cat&quot; has been rewritten. It is now fast and can process heavy arrays at high dimensions.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Warnings from &quot;fplot3d1&quot; called without an option were removed.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        &quot;whereis&quot; has been upgraded:
        <ul>
          <li>It can now be used for built-in functions.</li>
          <li>When the same function name is registered in several libraries, &quot;whereis&quot;
            now returns all of them instead of only the last loaded one.</li>
          <li>For unregistered user-defined macros, &quot;"script"&quot; is now returned
            instead of &quot;[]&quot;.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        &quot;mgetl&quot; speed has been improved for files with a lot of lines.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        &quot;ndgrid(x)&quot; now accepts only one input &quot;x&quot;, with by default &quot;y=x&quot;.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Some functions have been tagged obsolete and will be removed in Scilab 6.1: &quot;nanmin&quot;,
        &quot;nanmax&quot;, &quot;xgetech&quot;, &quot;lstsize&quot;, &quot;eval&quot; &amp; &quot;dgettext&quot; &amp; &quot;denom&quot; &amp; &quot;numer&quot;.

      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Bug fixes</h2>
      <p class="para">
        In this version, extra effort has been expended on bug fixing and stabilization.
        Detailed information about those improvements can be found on the <a href="CHANGES.html">CHANGES</a> file.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title">What was new in Scilab 6.0.0</h3>
      <h2 class="title">New language, new core &amp; new Xcos</h2>
      <p class="para">
        This release includes a major rewrite of Scilab's internal
        core, for better usability and performance: the changes to the
        visible aspects of the software are limited.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The first big internal change is a completely new language
        parser and interpreter.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The language changes are not all backward compatible. You will
        have to update your scripts/programs/modules, but it will be
        very simple in pretty much all cases.
        </p>
      <p class="para">
        The second big internal change is the ability to manipulate
        bigger data sets, without exhausting system resources.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Xcos - the graphical tool for dynamic systems modeling and simulation - also uses the
        new re-written Scilab engine, and is now running in native code, which should provide
        much better performance as well as support for much bigger models. Xcos can load and
        run models created with earlier versions of Scilab.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Utilities for code productivity</h2>
      <p class="para">This release includes also several features
        to write better and more efficient Scilab scripts:
        <ul>
          <li>A full-featured debugger is now included.</li>
          <li>A new profiler and coverage tool has been added.</li>
          <li>A &quot;lint&quot;-like command, slint, has been added,
          for code static analysis: it detects unclear, risky or
          suspicious code. It is not documented yet, however.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Newsfeed</h2>
      <p class="para">
        A new view is available in the visual environment of Scilab: the
        &quot;Newsfeed&quot;. It provides a continuous feed of news,
        tips and general communication from the community and from the Scilab Team.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Licensing changes</h2>
      <p class="para">
        Scilab is now released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.0.
        Prior to this version, Scilab was licensed under the terms of the CeCILL v2.1 and
        continues to be available under such terms.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        In this version, the Intel Math Kernel Library and the FFTW library optimized by Intel
        Math Kernel Library are included in Scilab. They are subject
        to the Intel EULA.
